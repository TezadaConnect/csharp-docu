## Chapter 1 Part 2

#### Understanding the concept of variables
Defining or declaring a variable is easy here is a guide for you.

```c#
<Datatype> <Variable name>; //<-- This is the pattern on how to declare a variable

<Datatype> <Variable name> = <Value>; //<-- This is how you define a variable
```

- Declaring or defining a variable needs data types
- Here are the list of data types for variables

  ```
  // List of datatypes
  
  string // string is use for storin texts.
  
  int // int is use for storing integer number.
  
  float // float is use for storing decimal number with 6 or 7 decimal point places.
  
  double // same as float but can store decimal places greater than float, 15 decimal places to be exact.
  
  bool // bool has two value it is use to store true/false or one/zero value.
  ```

- Defining or Declaring a variable needs a variable name and it is user define.
- userdefine means its up to the programmer to name it
- Variable name must not start with any special characters or number
- Naming a variable follows **Cammel case** naming convention.

  ```
  /* E.g.: A Cammel case naming convention starts with its first letter in lowercase. If a variable is consist of two words the second words first letter must be uppercase. */
  
  // hello
  
  // helloWorld
  
  // helloAbsoluteWorld
  ```
- This is how you declare a variable

  ```c#
  int myNumber;
  
  string myName;
  
  bool isOverweight;
  
  float myChange;
  
  double myMilliSecondRecord;
  ```
- In defining a variable, a programmer must assign or store a value appropriate for its data type.

  ```c#
  int myNumber = 24;
  
  string myName = "Eric";
  
  bool isOverweight = true;
  
  float myChange = 2.54;
  
  double myMilliSecondRecord = 45.5678;
  ```
- There are more datatype available in c# but these are the datatypes you'll going to use most of the time
- Programmers also make their own custom data type as they handle complex data in their project, which we will tackle in this training arc.
