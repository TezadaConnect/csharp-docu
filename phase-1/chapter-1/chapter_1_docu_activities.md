## Chapter 1 Activities

#### Arithmetic Operators

Write a program that asks the user to input two real numbers, n1 and n2 . Compute the sum n1 + n2 , the difference n1 − n2, the product n1 ⋅ n2 , and the quotient n1 / n2 (assume n2 ≠ 0 ), and output the results. Your program output should be formatted as follows:

```bash
Enter a real number n1: 
64.67
Enter a real number n2: 
-14.2
64.67 + -14.2 = 50.47
64.67 - -14.2 = 78.87
64.67 * -14.2 = -918.314
64.67 / -14.2 = -4.55423
```

#### Cube

Write a program that asks the user to input a real number n. Compute n3 and output the result. Your program output should be formatted as follows:

```bash
Enter a real number: 
7.12
7.12^3 = 360.944
```

#### Area/Circumference

Write a program that asks the user to input the radius r of a circle. Compute the area A and circumference C of the circle using the formulas A = π ⋅ r 2 and C = 2 ⋅ π ⋅ r respectively, and output the results. Note that for this exercise you can make the approximationπ ≈ 3.14 . Your program output should be formatted as follows:

```bash
Enter the radius of a circle: 
10
The area A of a circle with radius 10 = 314
The circumference C of a circle with radius 10 = 62.8
```

#### Average

Write a program that asks the user to input five real numbers. Compute the average of these numbers and output the results to the user. Your program output should be formatted as follows:

```bash
Enter a0: 
5
Enter a1: 
10
Enter a2: 
-2
Enter a3: 
2.7
Enter a4: 
0
The average of the five inputs a0...a4 = 3.14
```

#### Bug Fixing

The following code below contains several bugs. Enter the codes into your C# editor and try to compile it. What error/warning messages do you get? In complete sentences, describe what you think each error/warning message means. Afterwards, fix the errors so that it compiles correctly.
