# C# Godot Training Arc
This training arc repository is made to recreate all my experience in my game programmer trainee experience. I'm GGT in a game company where I was trained to code and make games using c++, java, and objective-c. Using those activity examples in the training, I will produce an equavalent to c# and godot.
